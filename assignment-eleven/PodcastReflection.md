# Assignment 11
The meeting I will attend is April 13th at 9am: Risk Working Group.

## Podcast Reflection
I thought it was a very informative introduction into the origins, purpose, and stories of CHAOSS. 
It was very eye opening to hear about the reach and goal of the CHAOSS project and I think that a
podcast is a very well chosen distribution method for the information they are trying to spread.
