# Assignment 11
The meeting I will attend is April 13th at 9am: Risk Working Group.

## Podcast Reflection
I thought it was a very informative introduction into the origins, purpose, and stories of CHAOSS. 
It was very eye opening to hear about the reach and goal of the CHAOSS project and I think that a
podcast is a very well chosen distribution method for the information they are trying to spread.

I never thought that so many different industries use open source software and the CHAOSS project
will help them to make informative decisions on which open source technologies they can leverge in
their industry. I also found the funding information for the project very insightful. I didn't 
previously know that open source software organizations recieved funding like this one does.
