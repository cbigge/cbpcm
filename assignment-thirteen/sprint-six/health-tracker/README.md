# Sprint Six - HealthIO

Im using `Nodejs`, `React`, `Express`, and `Bootstrap` for this app.

To run my in progress app, navigate to the frontend folder and run `npm start`.

## Done so far
- Created exercise and nutrition models in the backend
- Created api for backend communication
- Created mongodb database to store model data
- Created backend controllers for exercise and nutrition models
- Created react template frontend
