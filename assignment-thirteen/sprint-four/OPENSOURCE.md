# Assignment 13 - Open Source Reflections
The open source articles that I read were very informative on the benefits of contributing to open source, the complexity of a well managed open source project, and why individuals should contribute to open source. In the linuxfoundation's article, one thing I found interesting was how they explained the difficult relationship between an organization and a specific open source community that receives contributions from the organization that doesn't necessarily share the same values. The community needs to balance accepting contributions while keeping true to their values, which is a difficult task.
