# Assignment 13 - Reflection
    
## A description of which projects you looked at
- jasny/sso
- authelia/authelia
- tngan/samlify
- buzzfeed/sso
- balderdashy/sails
## Why you chose the one you did
I decided to go with `balderdashy/sails`. The reason I went with sails is:
- It has a very large user and contributor base, making it reliable.
- It run a `nodejs` server, making it easily implementable.
- It is built on a MVC framework, which I am a fan of.
- It comes with a well built out web app template.
## How far you got in making it work
The template system comes with all the default views, a User model, and a controller for accounts. Currently, signing up and logging in works 100% perfectly. When you are successfully authenticated, you will be redirected to a view that only logged in users can see. The log in system is built with SSO.
## What obstacles you encountered in the process
The largest obstacles I faced in this project was the variety of choices I had. It was difficult to figure out which was best project for me and what the pros and cons were of each that I looked in to. I also spent a lot of time researching how single sign on worked to make sure I had an understanding of what I was trying to implement, which was a good amount of work, but very fruitful work.
